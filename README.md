## What is it? ##
Tskapp is a task management platform, allowing you to perform crud operations on draggable widgets in an online environment.
Through use of the JQuery scripts and a glassfish server; we create task  widgets with user information, that can be moved, expanded, minimized and removed.

## Database ##
The database schema is very simple for this, the only user information being collected is email (for resetting password).  This is an individual
platform letting you leave a clipboard of tasks online for your own reference
